  <!-- About Thalem -->

      <h2>The Story of Thalem</h2>
      <p>
        Thalem was founded by Aggelos, a passionate armwrestler, bodybuilder and
        powerlifter. As a competitor in strength sports, he recognised the lack
        of serious and accessible tools for logging training sessions. Instead of
        waiting for someone else to build them, he decided to do it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built using a combination of modern programming and AI tools and
        countless hours of dedication, Thalem represents the belief that
        athletes deserve software as obsessive as they are about their craft.

      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Aggelos is an 18‑year‑old strength athlete and computer science
        student from Greece. When he's not on the table armwrestling or
        lifting heavy weights, he's writing code and studying how to turn
        his vision for Thalem into reality. His goal is to help the sport
        grow by giving athletes a powerful training logger at an affordable
        price.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        At Thalem we believe that data and discipline lead to progress. We
        refuse to fill our products with fluff or gimmicks. Instead, we
        focus on giving athletes the tools they need to track, analyse and
        improve – nothing more, nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Thalem is built by athletes, we understand how
        training fits into real lives. Our pricing is designed to be fair
        and accessible – just €3 for the full version of our first app – so
        that no one is priced out of excellence.
