  <!-- Roadmap Overview -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        Thalem is still at the beginning, but I know where I want to take it. I’m
        building slowly and carefully, making sure things actually work in real life
        training before moving on. Quality first, no rushed hype.
